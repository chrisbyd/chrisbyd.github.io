We have three papers accepted to the top-tier conference (Design Automation Conference (DAC)).
The names of these papers are:
1. PIM-DH: ReRAM-based Processing-in-Memory Architecture for Deep Hashing Acceleration.
2. SATO: Spiking Neural Network Acceleration via Temporal-Oriented Dataflow and Architecture.
3. EBSP: Evolving Bit Sparsity Patterns for Hardware-Friendly Inference of Quantized Deep Neural Networks.

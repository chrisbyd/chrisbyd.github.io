title: "DynSNN: A Dynamic Approach to Reduce Redundancy in Spiking Neural Networks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-010
excerpt: 'In this paper, inspired by the topology of neuronal co-activity in the neural system, we propose a dynamic pruning framework (dubbed DynSNN) for SNNs, enabling us to seamlessly optimize network topology on the ï¬‚y almost without accuracy loss.'
